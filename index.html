        In this essay I'll- (Jokes) <br/>
          When making this playlist, I wasn't sure exactly what message I wanted
          to convey. We both know we have the same taste so anything I would've
          put would be kind of redundant and disingenous. We also haven't been
          talking much so I don't quite know much about you, we don't have any memories
          either so I didn't have much to draw from.<br/><br/>
          What I do know is that we are way too far away, there is a mutual desire
          to connect more and I would like to introduce you to many more parts of me(Disclosure).
          Keeping the latter in mind, I'll have you know that I love explanations
          and context! 
          The playlist is constructed in such a way that the first third highlights 
          the distance between us, the second, expresses certain desires and general things
          I want to say and the last portion consists of bands and artists that I love
          dearly. I can't say where these sections start and end that's  your business<br/><br>
          Here are some of my favourite/most significant lines:<br><br>

          <em class="heading">Talk:</em><br />"I need to be over there,4 states a step away. Cause it's
          ocean and a sun of a different day. When I talk, when we talk"<br><br>

          <em class="heading">Chiot:<br /></em>A song as a nod to the fact that you haven't 
          had your first kiss yet <br>
          "My golden boy tastes sweeter in the morning/ My first kiss is a secret 
          on your lips"<br><br>

          <em class="heading">My boy:</em><br/>"My boy we don't see each other much. It'll take some time
          but somewhere along the line, we won't be alone"<br><br>

          <em class="heading">I wanna C you:</em><br />"I wanna see you"<br><br>

          <em class="heading">Ne me quitte pas(Don't leave me):</em><br />"It feels so good to know you"<br><br>

          <em class="heading">Sober to death:</em><br />"Hold on to ghost of my body, you know
          that good lives make bad stories, you can text me when punching mattresses
          gets old. Don't think it'll be this way, not comforted by anything I say,
          We were wrecks before we crashed into each other" also "Don't worry you and me
          won't be alone no more"<br><br>

          <em class="heading">Planet u:</em><br />"Such a worthy muse,otherwordly dude"<br><br>

          <em class="heading">Super8:</em><br />Most of the song except nothing is over???<br><br>

          <em class="heading">My boy:</em><br />"My boy we don't see each other much. It'll take some time
          but somewhere along the line, we won't be alone"<br><br>

          <em class="heading">S T R E T C H:</em><br />Generally cool. Highlights how broke I am
          and basically how everything is harder when both parties are broke "
          "Wanna be yours, all yours tonight but you won't love me unless I- got a stretch
          limousine..."<br><br>

          <em class="heading">My boy:</em><br />"My boy we don't see each other much. It'll take some time
          but somewhere along the line, we won't be alone"<br><br>

          <em class="heading">12:51:</em><br />I imagine it would sound like this if we met up.<br><br>

          <em class="heading">My boy:</em><br />"My boy we don't see each other much. It'll take some time
          but somewhere along the line, we won't be alone"<br><br>

          <em class="heading">Plastic:</em><br />"I know what it's like to behold and not be hold,
          funny how a stomach unfed seems satsified causes it's swell and swollen"<br><br>

          <em class="heading">love:</em><br />I DON'T SPEAK KOREAN. so this could mean anything. But isn't 
          it such a sweet song?<br><br>

          <em class="heading">My boy:</em><br />"My boy we don't see each other much. It'll take some time
          but somewhere along the line, we won't be alone"<br><br>

          <em class="heading">Quarrel:</em><br />Loved this song since grade 8."With you half the battle is proving that we're 
          at war. I would give my life just for the privelidge to ignore" and 
          "Calling this a quarrel so immorally implies, we're equal opponents and we both antagonize"<br><br>

          <em class="heading">We'll never have sex:</em><br />"You look perfect, you look different, I don't wonder about
          your indifference."<br><br>

          <em class="heading">Lovers rock:</em><br />Another soundtrack song<br><br>

          <em class="heading">Bodys:</em><br />You need to get into this band<br><br>

          <em class="heading">Labradors:</em><br />One of my favourite chord progressions: "I'm calling my head
          to come back to my feet"<br><br>

          <em class="heading">My boy:</em><br />"My boy we don't see each other much. It'll take some time
          but somewhere along the line, we won't be alone"<br><br>

          <em class="heading">Coogie:</em><br />My favourite artist for about 4 years now. This song is a mini
          essay in itself. Let me know if you wanna know.<br><br>

          <em class="heading">Annie:</em><br />My favourite song. maybe<br><br>

          <em class="heading">hunni:</em><br />I just think this is an appropriate end. bye bye.<br><br>
